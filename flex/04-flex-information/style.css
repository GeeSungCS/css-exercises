/* Take away after looking at solutions

Think of everything as boxes. So in this exercise I could think of
one container that is housing all the text and pictures by wrapping
one div over everything. And then I add another div to group the
picture and text together as one unit, so one container to house
the 4 smaller containers holding the text and pictues.

Another problem I need to fix is I'm trying to make the smaller 
containers do the heavy lifting when I should just be using
the main container housing it and only micro adjusting the smaller
when needed rather than the other way around.

On that note don't forget I can use the body as well to do things
like center the text.
